          Thanks for checking out our about page. Here we tell you a little more about
          who we are and what we can do for you. It's that simple. Basically, we are just 
          dancing our way through a homework assignment for Udemy's Ruby on Rails Developer Course. 
          We're learning rails and all of the sweet tools available for making web application development 
          as easy as two-step. Okay, well maybe not that easy.
